Software Structure for User Interfaces Project 3
Project Overview:

1. a Game object that models a game using state machines on an HTML5 Canvas. 

2. 5 actors were created, which each has their own state machine that are defined in actor.js, actions.js, and game.js. 

3. There are two buttons. Button1 changes the image/position of two actors and button2 moves two actors toward a third one.

3. Each state machine will react to events sent to the Canvas element, so the game engine has to appropriately dispatch events sent to it. 


Resources:
1. http://www.sitepoint.com/javascript-custom-events/ to check all available document events. 
2. Piazza. I used it a lot to check previous questions on drag events.
